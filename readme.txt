Rename the alternative text of your media easily directly using the Media Library, without a click.

Rename the alternative text of your media easily directly using the Media Library, without a click.

**BETA**. This plugin was just created. I am waiting for the first feedbacks of my users to decide which way to go. The first thing I will implement is to update the ALT in the POSTS.

**BE KIND**. Again, this plugin is new. Please help us :)
